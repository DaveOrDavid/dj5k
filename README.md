# Planning Process

I had known I was going to make this app for a while, but I wanted to utilize Bootstrap for more visual pop and ease of creation.

The main concern was 1) not spoiling the joke, so a modal with a dropdown for the punchline was use. (2) Using a 3rd party API as a test to myself and for Unauthenticated usage.

I wanted to use React to see how Component / State usage would be vs. POJO
